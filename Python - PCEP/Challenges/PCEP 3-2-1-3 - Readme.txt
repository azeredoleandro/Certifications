Scenario
A junior magician has chosen a secret number. He has hidden it in a variable called secret_number. He wants everyone running his program to play the Guess the Secret Number game and guess which number he has chosen for them. Those who don't guess the number will be stuck in an infinite loop forever! Unfortunately, he doesn't know how to complete the code.

Your task is to help the magician complete the code in the editor so that the code:

1. Asks the user to enter an integer.
2. Uses a while loop.
3. Checks if the number entered by the user is the same as the number chosen by the magician. If the number chosen by the user is different from the magician's secret number, the user should see the message "Ha ha! You're stuck in my loop!" and be prompted to enter another number. If the number entered by the user matches the magician's chosen number, the number should be printed on the screen, and the magician should say the following words: "Well done, muggle! You are free now."

The magician is counting on you! Don't disappoint him.

EXTRA INFORMATION

By the way, take a look at the print() function. The way we used it here is called multi-line printing. You can use triple quotes to print strings on multiple lines to make the text more readable or create a special text-based drawing. Give it a try.
